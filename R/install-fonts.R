#' Install Clear Sans

#' ideal for UI design. Its strong, recognizable forms avoid distracting ambiguity, making it

#' Install Eau Sans
#'
#' Eau Sans is (via the creator): "In 1992, I wanted to design a perfectly faceless typeface of my own.
#' I chose Eau, meaning water in French, as the name. I planned to do two variations; a sanserif and
#' a Roman serif style version. I could not decide on the design details for the Roman variation,
#' so only the sanserif version was completed. Although I think that Eau Sans needs more refinement,
#' present it here as it was originally designed. At the time of release, I re-formatted the Eau Sans
#' family with numeric characters in three variations: proportional, lining and old-styled figures.
#' This typeface is used for my electronic sound project: parabola."

#' Install Roboto Condensed
#'
#' Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
#' largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
#' curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
#' Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
#' width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
#' humanist and serif types.

#' Install Inter
#'
#' Inter is a typeface carefully crafted & designed for computer screens and
#' features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case
#' text. Several OpenType features are provided as well, like contextual
#' alternates that adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of surrounding
#' glyphs, slashed zero for when you need to disambiguate "0" from "o",
#' tabular numbers, etc.
