# #' Install Goldman Sans (Condensed)
# #'
# #' Goldman Sans is a clean, modern typeface designed for dense data-rich
# #' environments. From open letter shapes, enlarged x-height, and optical
# #' balancing of individual letterforms, we designed Goldman Sans with
# #' clarity in mind. Both normal and condensed versions are provided.

# #' Install Roboto Condensed
# #'
# #' Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
# #' largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
# #' curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
# #' Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
# #' width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
# #' humanist and serif types.

#' Install Inter
#'
#' Inter is a typeface carefully crafted & designed for computer screens and
#' features a tall x-height to aid in readability of mixed-case and lower-case
#' text. Several OpenType features are provided as well, like contextual
#' alternates that adjusts punctuation depending on the shape of surrounding
#' glyphs, slashed zero for when you need to disambiguate "0" from "o",
#' tabular numbers, etc.
