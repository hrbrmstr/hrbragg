\title{Install Roboto Condensed}
\usage{
install_roboto_condensed()
}
\description{
Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm,
Roboto doesnâ€™t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural
width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in
humanist and serif types.
